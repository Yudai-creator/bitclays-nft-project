              One of the most significant creations of Mankind is also one 
              of the most taken for granted. The written word. How could 
              we as a species advance into the complex civilizations, that 
              we also take for granted, without this underappreciated bit 
              of technology? The short answer is that we could not.

              The Sumerian people inhabited ancient Mesopotamia. This 
              area is also known as the Fertile Crescent, due to Mesopotamia 
              being situated between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. 
              Thanks to the seasonal flooding of these rivers, the land 
              was fertile and lush. This allowed for our ancestors to 
              develop an Agrarian civilization as opposed to being 
              hunter/gatherers.

              This new way of life required a way to keep records reliably. 
              Prior to this time, humans used oral tradition to record their 
              history. However this growing Nation State with its new 
              technologies would not be able to rely on oral tradition for 
              long. As more people settled in and near the cities, the 
              inhabitants needed to be able to keep records related to 
              agriculture and trade especially.

              The first Sumerian pictographs etched into clay appeared 
              around 3,500 B.C. and we call this early form of writing 
              Cuneiform. These first tablets did not contain stories of the 
              Mesopotamian gods such as Enki or Enlil, nor did they enthrall 
              the reader with ancient myths and legends. These first tablets 
              simply were ledgers related to the trade and movement of 
              grain and other agricultural commodities.
